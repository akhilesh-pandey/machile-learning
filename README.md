Here I'm providing two code: logistic regression for binary class classification and logistic regression for multi class classification (for classifying a as a number between 0 and 9).
The training data set is assumed to be named as trainData.mat and trainLabels.mat respectively.
Similarly, test data and test labels are assumed to be named as testData.mat and testLabels.mat respectively.
