# machile-learning
This repository contains few machine learning codes. Many more codes will be added to this repository.

## Logistic regression:
logistic regression for binary class classification and logistic regression for multi class classification (for classifying a as a number between 0 and 9).
The training data set is assumed to be named as trainData.mat and trainLabels.mat respectively.
Similarly, test data and test labels are assumed to be named as testData.mat and testLabels.mat respectively.
## Softmax regression
For multiple class classification

## Linear Regression<par>
Data set used is boston dataset from sklearn

Any suggestion and criticism to the further improvement of these codes are most welcome.
